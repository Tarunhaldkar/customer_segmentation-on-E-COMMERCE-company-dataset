# customer_segmentation-on-E-COMMERCE-company
using RFM analysis
ABSTRACT
In this project segment the customers of an e-commerce company by using the RFM approach. This will enable the e-commerce company to optimize their retention and acquisition strategies.


Here is this folder structure,
1. dataset

7. Use K-mean model for clustering
8. Arange customer in high-level, medium-level and low-level 


What is the RFM Model?
The Recency, Frequency, & Monetary (RFM) Model is a classic analytics and segmentation tool for identifying your best customers. 
RFM Model is a powerful way to identify group of customer for special treatment.
​

We often use this concept to divide customers to different segment like high-value customer, medium-value customer, low-value customer.
RFM stands for the three dimensions:
Recency – How recently has the customer made a tranction.
Frequency – How frequent is the customer in ordering/buying some product from us.
Monetary Value – How much does the customer spend on purchasing product from us.

Benefites of customer segmentation
1) Identify least and most profitable customers, thus helping the business to concentrate marketing activities.
2) Build loyal relationships with customers by developing and offering them the products and service they want.
3) Improve customer service
4) Maximize the use of your services
5) Improve products to meet customer requirements.

1) Low Value: Customers who are less active than others, not very frequent buyer/visitor and generates very low - zero.
2) Mid Value: In the middle of everything. Often using our platform (but not as much as our High Values), fairly frequent and generates moderate revenue.
3) High Value: The group we don’t want to lose. High Revenue, Frequency and low Inactivity.

Actions to be taken
We can start taking actions with this segmentation. The main strategies are quite clear:
High Value: Improve Retention
Mid Value: Improve Retention + Increase Frequency
Low Value: Increase Frequency
